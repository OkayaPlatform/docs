It addresses the challenge of filtering through vast amounts of financial news by providing personalized advice and insights. 
Tailored to individual preferences, it delivers summarized and sentiment-analyzed content, making it easier for users to stay informed about relevant financial topics. 
This guide explains how to create this sophisticated system, offering an efficient way to access financial news that matters most to you.




# Key Concepts 

To create personalized financial advice, this project will leverage Okaya.ai's capabilities, including:

  1. üåê **Web Scraping for Data Retrieval**: This process involves programmatically accessing and extracting relevant financial news from online sources like Yahoo Finance. It allows the bot to gather a wide range of articles based on user-specified topics.

  2. üí¨ **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Summarization**: Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the bot distills lengthy articles into concise summaries. This step is crucial for providing users with quick, digestible insights without the need to read through entire articles.

  3. üîç **Sentiment Analysis**: By employing sentiment analysis algorithms, the bot evaluates the tone and emotional context of each news summary. This feature is instrumental in determining whether the news sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral, offering users an additional layer of understanding about the financial market's mood and trends.

Together, these technologies form the backbone of the Finance News Bot, enabling it to provide personalized, relevant, and insightful financial news summaries efficiently.
