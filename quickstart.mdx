## Setup your development

After you have finished all 3 steps, Initialize the client with api keys and optionally your environment. In the example we are using the cloud environment which is also the default. The Python client can modify all entities in the Okaya Platform and therefore requires the secret key. 

```env .env 
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
    PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY=<YOUR_PROMPTLAYER_API_KEY>

```
