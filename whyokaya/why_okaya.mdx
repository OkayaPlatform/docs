# Key Concepts 

To create personalized financial advice, this project will leverage Okaya.ai's capabilities, including:

  1. üåê **Web Scraping for Data Retrieval**: This process involves programmatically accessing and extracting relevant financial news from online sources like Yahoo Finance. It allows the bot to gather a wide range of articles based on user-specified topics.

  2. üí¨ **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Summarization**: Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the bot distills lengthy articles into concise summaries. This step is crucial for providing users with quick, digestible insights without the need to read through entire articles.

  3. üîç **Sentiment Analysis**: By employing sentiment analysis algorithms, the bot evaluates the tone and emotional context of each news summary. This feature is instrumental in determining whether the news sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral, offering users an additional layer of understanding about the financial market's mood and trends.

Together, these technologies form the backbone of the Finance News Bot, enabling it to provide personalized, relevant, and insightful financial news summaries efficiently.


# Building Blocks 

Creating the Finance News Bot involves integrating several technologies, each providing essential capabilities for the bot‚Äôs functionality:

  1. üï∏Ô∏è **Web Scraping Tools**: For programmatically accessing and extracting financial news from online sources such as Yahoo Finance, based on user-specified topics.

  2. üß† **Okaya.ai for Prompt Management, Summarization, and Sentiment Analysis**: Okaya.ai is employed for two crucial aspects - summarizing detailed financial articles into concise overviews, and analyzing the sentiment of these summaries. It utilizes advanced AI models to interpret the content and tone of news articles, providing users with both summaries and sentiment insights.

  3. üóÑÔ∏è **Database Management System**: This system stores the summarized news articles along with their sentiment analysis. It categorizes and archives each news piece for efficient retrieval, organization, and later analysis.

Together, these components enable the Finance News Bot to efficiently deliver personalized, summarized, and sentiment-analyzed financial news, making it a comprehensive tool for users to stay updated with financial information tailored to their interests.
